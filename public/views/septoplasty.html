This lack of structure makes it difficult to quantify surgical skill. My work: </strong><ul><li>Extracted novel motion-based features for kernel support vector machine to improve automatic classification of surgical skill to 91%</li><li>Developed real-time 3D tool-tracking visualization tool</li><li>Built intuitive video segmentation tool to reduce time spent in labeling segments of live-surgical videos</li></ul></div></div></div>
